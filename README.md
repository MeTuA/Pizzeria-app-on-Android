# Pizzeria-app-on-Android
## First Commit

This is the app for a pizzeria on Android.
Not complete. Implemented only the "Create Order" button and share button.
To implement the "Create Order" button, I removed ActionBar and made(wrote) Toolbar instead of ActionBar.
To implement the "Share" button, I used the share action provider. Also, was created menu_main.xml file for 
adding new toolbars.

Also was implemented ListView of products in a pizzeria on the main activity(MainActivity.java).
Implemented DrinkCategoryActivity, which shows the category of drinks, and DrinkActivity which shows details of drinks.
Drink class gives information about drinks.
